    "# INTRODUCTION\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python project analyzes the relationship between socio-economic factors and opioid overdose deaths across counties in New York State. The analysis explores variables such as poverty rates, high school dropout rates, mental health, and healthcare access to determine their predictive power regarding opioid-related fatalities, with the aim of uncovering insights that can inform public health strategies and interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Next steps: A split rural-urban analysis seems best, as these areas appear to behave differently than one another regarding opioid death trends. However, we don't have enough data from which to draw conclusive results in this way. So, we'll repeat this analysis for counties across the nation and see if clearer trends emerge. For this national analysis, we'll proceed in a new notebook.*"

    "The magnitude of our correlations, across the board, are still quite low, with the strongest correlation being between unemployment percentage and opioid death rates within urban NY counties (r = 0.38). What is most striking, however, is the difference in correlations between urban and rural counties. For example, the unemployment percentage predictor has a correlation of 0.38 for urban counties, but -0.25 for urban counties (a difference of 0.63 between the two). This shows that the conditions leading to opioid death rates may differ between urban and rural areas within New York.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, further analysis should be performed when splitting counties into urban and rural areas. The problem with this approach, however, is that we run low on data within each group from which to draw conclusive results. There are a total of 62 counties in New York which we've been analyzing -- already a fairly limited number. When we split these groups into urban and rural, however, our sample sizes drop to 21 for urban and 41 for rural -- too few to perform a more confident and detailed analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to pursue a split urban-rural analysis of opioid death predictors, we should expand our dataset to include not only New York counties, but counties across the US. This analysis will be more complex, but may produce clearer and more reliable results due to the increased sample size.\n",

    "# RESULTS\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis conducted on the relationship between socio-economic factors and opioid overdose deaths across counties in New York State revealed several key insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Univariate Analysis\n",
    "Each of the variables studied—poverty percentage, dropout percentage, poor mental health percentage, recent checkup percentage, lack of access to medical care due to cost percentage, and unemployment percentage—was examined individually. The distributions were generally normal with some minor outliers. None of these outliers significantly skewed the data, so we did not remove or alter any data points before analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bivariate Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The bivariate analysis indicates minimal correlation between the predictors and opioid death rates across New York counties:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Poverty percentage: r = 0.01\n",
    "* Dropout percentage: r = 0.22\n",
    "* Poor mental health percentage: r = 0.00\n",
    "* Recent checkup percentage: r = 0.12\n",
    "* No medical care due to cost percentage: r = 0.06\n",
    "* Unemployment percentage: r = -0.27\n",
    "* Urban score: r = 0.03\n",
    "\n",
    "Scatterplots reinforce the lack of discernible correlation. However, when the data is divided into urban and rural groups, notable differences emerge. While the rural group continues to show minimal correlation, the urban group exhibits a weak positive correlation for most predictors. This suggests that further analysis should explore the urban-rural divide in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Split Urban vs. Rural Analysis\n",
    "When splitting the data into urban and rural counties, some trends became clearer:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Urban Counties: Correlations with opioid death rates were generally stronger in urban areas, particularly for unemployment (r = 0.38), poverty (r = 0.37), and poor mental health (r = 0.33).\n",
    "* Rural Counties: In contrast, rural areas showed weak or negative correlations across all factors, with unemployment showing a negative correlation (r = -0.25) with opioid deaths.\n",
    "\n",
    "The differences between urban and rural correlations suggest that the socio-economic dynamics influencing opioid deaths may vary significantly between these environments. Opioid death rates in urban areas seem to be more sensitive to changes in socio-economic conditions, while in rural areas they may be influenced by other factors. However, more data is needed to further explore these results, as the split analysis used small sample sizes (only 21 urban counties and 41 rural counties).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regression Analysis\n",
    "Due to the weak correlations observed, a reliable predictive model for opioid deaths could not be built using the current dataset. The strongest correlations in urban areas (e.g., unemployment) were still not robust enough to produce a model with high predictive power. Further analysis with more data may be helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This analysis highlights the complexity of opioid-related fatalities and the need for further exploration with more comprehensive data. The difference in correlations between urban and rural counties indicates that different strategies may be required to address opioid deaths in these areas. The next steps will involve expanding the dataset to include national data, which will increase the sample size and may help in uncovering more definitive trends. This approach should allow for a more detailed exploration of the factors contributing to opioid deaths across various socio-economic landscapes."
