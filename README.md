This ongoing Python project analyzes the relationship between socio-economic factors and opioid overdose deaths across counties in New York State. The analysis explores variables such as poverty rates, high school dropout rates, mental health, and healthcare access to determine their predictive power regarding opioid-related fatalities, with the aim of uncovering insights that can inform public health strategies and interventions.

*Note: This is a work in progress. Given the complexity of the opioid crisis, there are still many more factors to explore.*

*Next steps: explore unemployment rates as a predictor*
