This Python project analyzes the relationship between socio-economic factors and opioid overdose deaths across counties in New York State. The analysis explores variables such as poverty rates, high school dropout rates, mental health, and healthcare access to determine their predictive power regarding opioid-related fatalities, with the aim of uncovering insights that can inform public health strategies and interventions.

*Next steps: A split rural-urban analysis seems best, as these areas appear to behave differently than one another regarding opioid death trends. However, we don't have enough data from which to draw conclusive results in this way. So, we'll repeat this analysis for counties across the nation and see if clearer trends emerge. For this national analysis, we'll proceed in a new notebook.*
